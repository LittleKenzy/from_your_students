          Today isn’t just another birthday, it’s a celebration of the
          incredible impact you’ve made on all of us. Your passion for teaching
          English has opened doors to worlds of stories, language, and dreams we
          never knew existed. As our homeroom teacher, you’ve been so much more
          than just an educator, you’ve been our mentor, supporter, and even the
          voice of reason when we needed guidance most.
          <br /><br />
          From patiently helping us with tricky grammar, sharing your excitement
          for Shakespeare, to genuinely caring for each of us, you’ve shown what
          it truly means to teach from the heart. Mam Risa, thank you for
          believing in us even when we doubted ourselves, and for turning every
          lesson into an adventure instead of a chore.
          <br /><br />
          On your special day, we hope you feel just as valued and celebrated as
          you make us feel every single day in class. Here’s to another year of
          inspiring minds, shaping dreams, and continuing to be the
          extraordinary teacher we’re so lucky to have. Happy Birthday, Mam
          Risa!
          <br /><br />
          Here's to another year of inspiring minds, changing lives, and being
          the extraordinary teacher you are!
